AWS Cloud Plugin for Elasticsearch
==================================

The Amazon Web Service (AWS) Cloud plugin allows to use [AWS API](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java)
for the unicast discovery mechanism and add S3 repositories.

In order to install the plugin, simply run: `bin/plugin -install elasticsearch/elasticsearch-cloud-aws/2.0.0.RC1`.

* For master elasticsearch versions, look at [master branch](https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-cloud-aws/tree/master).

## Generic Configuration

The plugin will automatically use the instance level security credentials (as of 1.7.0), but they can be provided explicitly using `cloud.aws.access_key` and `cloud.aws.secret_key`:

    cloud:
        aws:
            access_key: AKVAIQBF2RECL7FJWGJQ
            secret_key: vExyMThREXeRMm/b/LRzEB8jWwvzQeXgjqMX+6br


### Region

The `cloud.aws.region` can be set to a region and will automatically use the relevant settings for both `ec2` and `s3`. The available values are:

* `us-east` (`us-east-1`)
* `us-west` (`us-west-1`)
* `us-west-1`
* `us-west-2`
* `ap-southeast` (`ap-southeast-1`)
* `ap-southeast-1`
* `ap-southeast-2`
* `ap-northeast` (`ap-northeast-1`)
* `eu-west` (`eu-west-1`)
* `sa-east` (`sa-east-1`).


## EC2 Discovery

ec2 discovery allows to use the ec2 APIs to perform automatic discovery (similar to multicast in non hostile multicast environments). Here is a simple sample configuration:

    cloud:
        aws:
            access_key: AKVAIQBF2RECL7FJWGJQ
            secret_key: vExyMThREXeRMm/b/LRzEB8jWwvzQeXgjqMX+6br

    discovery:
        type: ec2

The following are a list of settings (prefixed with `discovery.ec2`) that can further control the discovery:

* `groups`: Either a comma separated list or array based list of (security) groups. Only instances with the provided security groups will be used in the cluster discovery. (NOTE: You could provide either group NAME or group ID.)
* `host_type`: The type of host type to use to communicate with other instances. Can be one of `private_ip`, `public_ip`, `private_dns`, `public_dns`. Defaults to `private_ip`.
* `availability_zones`: Either a comma separated list or array based list of availability zones. Only instances within the provided availability zones will be used in the cluster discovery.
* `any_group`: If set to `false`, will require all security groups to be present for the instance to be used for the discovery. Defaults to `true`.
* `ping_timeout`: How long to wait for existing EC2 nodes to reply during discovery. Defaults to `3s`. If no unit like `ms`, `s` or `m` is specified, milliseconds are used.

### Filtering by Tags

The ec2 discovery can also filter machines to include in the cluster based on tags (and not just groups). The settings to use include the `discovery.ec2.tag.` prefix. For example, setting `discovery.ec2.tag.stage` to `dev` will only filter instances with a tag key set to `stage`, and a value of `dev`. Several tags set will require all of those tags to be set for the instance to be included.

One practical use for tag filtering is when an ec2 cluster contains many nodes that are not running elasticsearch. In this case (particularly with high `ping_timeout` values) there is a risk that a new node's discovery phase will end before it has found the cluster (which will result in it declaring itself master of a new cluster with the same name - highly undesirable). Tagging elasticsearch ec2 nodes and then filtering by that tag will resolve this issue.

### Automatic Node Attributes

Though not dependent on actually using `ec2` as discovery (but still requires the cloud aws plugin installed), the plugin can automatically add node attributes relating to ec2 (for example, availability zone, that can be used with the awareness allocation feature). In order to enable it, set `cloud.node.auto_attributes` to `true` in the settings.


## S3 Repository

The S3 repository is using S3 to store snapshots. The S3 repository can be created using the following command:

    $ curl -XPUT 'http://localhost:9200/_snapshot/my_s3_repository' -d '{
        "type": "s3",
        "settings": {
            "bucket": "my-bucket-name",
            "region": "us-west"
        }
    }'

The following settings are supported:

* `bucket`: The name of the bucket to be used for snapshots. (Mandatory)
* `region`: The region where bucket is located. Defaults to US Standard
* `base_path`: Specifies the path within bucket to repository data. Defaults to root directory.
* `access_key`: The access key to use for authentication. Defaults to value of `cloud.aws.access_key`.
* `secret_key`: The secret key to use for authentication. Defaults to value of `cloud.aws.secret_key`.
* `concurrent_streams`: Throttles the number of streams (per node) preforming snapshot operation. Defaults to `5`.
* `chunk_size`: Big files can be broken down into chunks during snapshotting if needed. The chunk size can be specified in bytes or by using size value notation, i.e. `1g`, `10m`, `5k`. Defaults to `100m`.
* `compress`: When set to `true` metadata files are stored in compressed format. This setting doesn't affect index files that are already compressed by default. Defaults to `false`.

The S3 repositories are using the same credentials as the rest of the S3 services provided by this plugin (`discovery` and `gateway`). They can be configured the following way:

    cloud:
        aws:
            access_key: AKVAIQBF2RECL7FJWGJQ
            secret_key: vExyMThREXeRMm/b/LRzEB8jWwvzQeXgjqMX+6br


Multiple S3 repositories can be created. If the buckets require different credentials, then define them as part of the repository settings.

## Recommended S3 Permissions

In order to restrict the Elasticsearch snapshot process to the minimum required resources, we recommend using Amazon IAM in conjunction with pre-existing S3 buckets. Here is an example policy which will allow the snapshot access to an S3 bucket named "snaps.example.com". This may be configured through the AWS IAM console, by creating a Custom Policy, and using a Policy Document similar to this (changing snaps.example.com to your bucket name).

```js
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::snaps.example.com"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::snaps.example.com/*"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "Version": "2012-10-17"
}

```

You may further restrict the permissions by specifying a prefix within the bucket, in this example, named "foo".

```js
{
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Condition": {
                "StringLike": {
                    "s3:prefix": [
                        "foo/*"
                    ]
                }
            },
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::snaps.example.com"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Action": [
                "s3:GetObject",
                "s3:PutObject",
                "s3:DeleteObject"
            ],
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:s3:::snaps.example.com/foo/*"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "Version": "2012-10-17"
}

```

## Testing

Integrations tests in this plugin require working AWS configuration and therefore disabled by default. Three buckets and two iam users have to be created. The first iam user needs access to two buckets in different regions and the final bucket is exclusive for the other iam user. To enable tests prepare a config file elasticsearch.yml with the following content:

```
cloud:
    aws:
        access_key: AKVAIQBF2RECL7FJWGJQ
        secret_key: vExyMThREXeRMm/b/LRzEB8jWwvzQeXgjqMX+6br

repositories:
    s3:
        bucket: "bucket-name"
        region: "us-west-2"
        private-bucket:
            bucket: <bucket not accessible by default key>
            access_key: <access key>
            secret_key: <access key>
        remote-bucket:
            bucket: <bucket in other region>
            region: <region>

```

Replace all occurrences of `access_key`, `secret_key`, `bucket` and `region` with your settings. Please, note that the test will delete all snapshot/restore related files in the specified buckets.

To run test:

```sh
mvn -Dtests.aws=true -Des.config=/path/to/config/file/elasticsearch.yml clean test
```
